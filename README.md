## Known Buggs

Sadly i failed to get the robot move perfectly so a few bugs i did not managed to fix before deadline

-Robot just can do left turns what works fine if the track is just a square and the direction he should go is **against** the clock

-Counting rounds is unreliable because of the randomness of light and the sensors i guess...

-Turning right just works sometime could not figure out the reason for that either one rotor is stronger than the other or i dont know :(
